<span style="font-size: smaller;">*The following exercise is from Chapter 7 of the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig; published by No Strach Press. The malware sample used in this lab can be found - [here](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs).*</span>

## Q1 - How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves persistence) when the computer is restarted?

![screenshot 1](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s1.PNG?raw=true) _Main function_
Starting with the main function, we observe the referencing of ``ServicesStartTable`` and a call to 
``StartServiceCtrlDispatcherA`` function, which is used to register the process with the *Service Control Manager (SCM)*.

Next, a call is made to *sub_401040*, where we encounter the [``CreateServiceA``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-createservicea) function for the service named ``Newservice``. The parameters ``dwStartType`` and ``dwErrorControl`` are set to 2 and 0, respectively. 
These values indicate that the service is configured to start automatically at system startup, ignore errors and continue the startup operation, maintaining persistence in the environment. 

## Q2 - Why does this program use a mutex?

![screenshot 3](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s3.PNG?raw=true) _sub_401040_
A mutex is a lock that controls access to a shared resource, preventing simultaneous access by multiple threads/processes. Malware can create a named mutex during execution and check if
it already exists to determine if it has been executed before.

In this sample, the program starts by attempting to open an existing mutex named ``S43921``. If the mutex does not exist, it jumps to *loc_401064* to create a mutex with that name. It also performs other actions for persistence, such as using ``CreateServiceA``, ``SetWaitableTimer``, ``WaitForSingleObject``, and ``Sleep``.

## Q3 - What is a good host-based signature to use for detecting this program?

To detect this sample, a good host-based signature should be able to identify the generated mutex as - ``43921``, and the service – ``NewService``.

## Q4 - What is a good network-based signature for detecting this malware? 

For network-based signature, it should blacklist the URL –
``http://www.INFO43921_Sample_01.com`` and the user agent – ``Internet Explorer 8.0``

## Q5 - What is the purpose of this program?

For the purpose of persistence, along with the creation of the mutex, the sample sets up a timer that waits till the year ``2100`` before proceeding to create multiple threads and executing the subroutine, ``StartAddress`` function. 

![screenshot 4](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s15.PNG?raw=true) _Timer_ 
![screenshot 5](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s5.PNG?raw=true) _StartAddress_ 
``StartAddress`` function attempts to  connect to the domain 
*“http://www.INFO43921_Sample_01.com”* . If a large number of computers run this sample, the website is set to experience a distributed *denial-of-service*(DDos) on ``January 1, 2100``. 

## Q6 - When will this program finish executing? 

The program would never finish executing. 
The ``StartAddress`` function will be running in an infintite loop, trying to connect to the website, once the wait time on the object is over on ``Januray 1, 2100``. It will only stop when the system is shut down but it would begin again at system startup.
