<span style="font-size: smaller;">*The following exercise is from Chapter 12 of the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig; published by No Strach Press. The malware sample used in this lab can be found - [here](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs).*</span>

## Q1 - What is the purpose of this malicious payload?
![screenshot 1](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s1.PNG?raw=true) _Main function_
The sample is a keylogger.<br>
Starting with the ``main function``, we see a call to the [``SetWindowsHookExA``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa) function, which is
used to install a hook procedure capable of monitoring system events on Windows operatingsystems.

In the ``sub_4010C7`` function, we observe the creation of a file named - ``INFO43921malwareanalysis.log`` , where the logged keys are stored. 

## Q2 - How does the malicious payload inject itself?
![screenshot 3](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s3.PNG?raw=true) _main function_
As mentioned earlier, the [``SetWindowsHookExA``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa) function is used to install a hook procedure that can monitor system events on Windows operating systems. In hexadecimal notation, ``0Dh`` represents the decimal value ``13``, indicating that the referenced hook procesure is [``WH_KEYBOARD_LL``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa), which monitors low-level keyboard input events.
![screenshot 4](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s4.PNG?raw=true) _fn function_
The offset of the hook function is located at ``fn``, which calls ``sub_4010C7`` function. The function, a file is created and keyboard input events are written to it. 

## Q3 - What filesystem residue does the program create?
![screenshot 5](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s5.PNG?raw=true) _sub_4010C7_
![screenshot 6](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s6.PNG?raw=true) _INFO43921malwareanalysis.log_
In the ``sub_4010C7`` function, we observe the creation of a file named ``INFO43921malwareanalysis.log``, where the keys are logged.
