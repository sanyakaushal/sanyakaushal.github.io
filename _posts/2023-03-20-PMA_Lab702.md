<span style="font-size: smaller;">*The following exercise is from Chapter 7 of the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig; published by No Strach Press. The malware sample used in this lab can be found - [here](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs).*</span>

## Q1 - How does this program achieve persistence?
![screenshot 1](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s6.PNG?raw=true) _Main function_
No persistence is maintained in this sample.
In the main function, the sample begins with calling [``OleInitialize``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ole2/nf-ole2-oleinitialize#parameters) and [``CoCreateInstance``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance) from
``ole32.dll``,  which are used in [``COM(Component Object Model)``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/the-com-library) programming. The purpose of ``CoCreateInstance`` is to create an instance of a COM object that has not yet been initialized.
This function creates a single object of a class that is linked to a specific CLSID (Class Identifier).

In the image above, we see that ``OleUnitialize`` is called to release any resources that were allocated during the call to [``OleInitialize``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ole2/nf-ole2-oleinitialize#parameters).

## Q2 - What is the purpose of this program?

![screenshot 3](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s8.PNG?raw=true)
The purpose of the sample is to open the following link -
``http://www.INFO43921Sample0102.com/xy.html``.
In the main function, we see that after initializing a COM object, a string containing the URL is passed for execution. 
![screenshot 4](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s9.PNG?raw=true) _Internet Explorer_
When running the sample in debugging mode, we can see the an attempt to connect to the website in Internet Explorer browser. 

## Q3 - When will this program finish executing?

![screenshot 5](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab7_s11.PNG?raw=true) _Graph of main function's end_
The program finishes executing after loading the website. 
The image above shows the flow of the programsâ€™s execution towards the end, where after calling ``OleUnitialized`` to release any resources that allocated during the call to ``OleInitialize``, it proceeds to ``loc_401085`` to deallocate the stack space.
