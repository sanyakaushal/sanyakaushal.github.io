*This is a walkthrough that investigates a compromised web server logs and PCAP (Packet Capture). WE will uncover the attacker's brute-force attack, privilege escalation, creation of a backdoor user, and command injection exploitation. Lets begin!* 

## Signs of Brute Force:

Reviewing the *auth.log*  for any suspicous activity, we notice multiple failed login attempts. The volume and frequency of the login attempts suggests its a brute force attack. Analyzing the logs further reveals the following:
<br>
``
Target Account: "user" 
``
<br>
``
Source IP: The numerous failed login attempts are from 142.55.0.11
``

## Success and Suspicious Activity:
Regarding the success of the brute force attack, there are instances of successful logins into the ``"user"`` account. However, these sessions are short-lived, automatically closing within a few seconds. The persistence of the brute force attempts around these successful logins raises suspicion.

An intriguing event occurres at 14:04:02, where a successful login takes place. This session, marked as ``session 22``, displays suspicious activity with the creation of a new user named ``"uesr"``. The brute force attacks cease after this event, making ``session 22`` highly suspicious.

## Evidence of New User Creation:

Fig.3 shows the creation of the ``"uesr"`` account, which can be easily mistaken for the legitimate "user" account by system administrators.

The relevance of this new user creation to system compromise is that the attacker can now utilize the ``"uesr"`` account to gain access to the server, even if the password for the ``"user"`` account is changed. This can potentially evade detection since it closely resembles a valid username.

## Suspicious/Malicious HTTP Commands - Command Injection Attack:
To uncover any suspicious or malicious HTTP commands, we examine the captured commands and their potential implications:
![screenshot 4](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/df2_4.PNG?raw=true) _Apache access.log_
The captured commands indicate that the attacker utilized a PHP web shell to establish a shell session on the target machine and continue their attack. The attacker sent ``GET`` requests with shell commands to execute on the server.

The commands included listing files using ``'ls'``, checking the user with ``'whoami'``, and attempting to copy the ``"customer.csv"`` file to various locations.

Eventually, the attacker succeeded in copying the sensitive ``customer.csv`` file, which contains personal information such as full names, emails, and credit card numbers of customers.

## Prevention Measures:
To mitigate similar attacks, several preventive measures can be implemented:
* Use stronger passwords or implement key-based authentication.
* Consider using nonstandard SSH ports to make it harder for attackers to find the SSH service.
* Implement mechanisms to limit login attempts and install a firewall to block suspicious login attempts.
* Adhere to the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts, granting only necessary privileges.
* Regularly audit file events, including create, modify, and delete actions.
Monitor HTTP logs for signs of data exfiltration or suspicious activities.
