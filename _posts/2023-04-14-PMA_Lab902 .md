<span style="font-size: smaller;">*The following exercise is from Chapter 9 of the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig; published by No Strach Press. The malware sample used in this lab can be found - [here](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs).*</span>

## Q1 - What strings do you see statically in the binary?
![screenshot 1](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s12.PNG?raw=true) _Strings output over the binary_
Other than imports, API function names and 'cmd' string, no interesting strings appear statically. 

## Q2 - What happens when you run this binary? 
When executed, the sample does nothing. It just terminates.

## Q3 - How can you get this sample to run its malicious payload?

In the main function, [``GetModuleFileNameA``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getmodulefilenamea) is used to retrieve its own executable name, which is then processed to remove the path information using ``_strrchr``. Afterwards, the malware proceeds to compare the extracted filename with ``ocl.exe``. If the two do not match, the malware will terminate. Therefore, in order to execute the malware, it must be renamed as ``ocl.exe``.

## Q4 - What is happening at 0x00401133?
![screenshot 3](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s9.PNG?raw=true) _Hex to ASCII conversion_
IDA Pro performed the conversion for us, and we can observe 2 strings created at ``0x00401133`` –
``1qaz2wsx3edc`` and ``ocl.exe``.

## Q5 - What arguments are being passed to subroutine 0x00401089?
![screenshot 4](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s10.PNG?raw=true) _ubroutine 0x00401089_
Two arguments are passed to subroutine ``0x00401089`` – Arg1 = ``ASCII 1qaz2wsx3edc`` and Arg2 =
``19FD40``.

## Q6 - What domain name does this malware use?
![screenshot 5](https://github.com/sanyakaushal/images/blob/main/Lab9_s11.PNG?raw=true) _Domain revealved_
After running through the subroutine ``0x00401089``, the domain is revealed as ``www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com``. It is passed to the imported function - ``gethostname``.
 
## Q7 - What encoding routine is being used to obfuscate the domain name?
In subroutine ``0x00401089`` - the sample deciphers a string using the xor key ``1qaz2wsx3edc``.

## Q8 - What is the signifiance of the CreateProcessA call at 0x0040106E?
At the address ``0x0040106E``, a [``CreateProcessA``](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa) call is made, initializing the execution of ``cmd.exe``. During this process, the standard input(``stdin``), standard output (``stdout``), and standard error (``strerr``) are redirected to the socket created by the malware.<br> 
This configuration signifies the spawning of a reverse shell, designed to receieve commands from the attacker's server.
